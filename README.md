# Identification-of-second-order-transfer-function-with-time-delay
This repository focuses on identifying a dynamic system using a second-order model with time delay. The model is characterized by parameters such as process gain, natural frequency, damping ratio, and time delay.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection: Obtain input-output data through system tests, such as step, impulse, or frequency response experiments.
Model Approximation: Analyze the system's response to approximate the model parameters using techniques like curve fitting, optimization, or graphical methods.
Parameter Estimation:
Process Gain: Represents the steady-state relationship between input and output.
Natural Frequency: Describes the oscillatory nature of the system.
Damping Ratio: Indicates how quickly oscillations decay.
Time Delay: Captures the time lag between the input change and the initial output response.
This repository includes code and practical examples to demonstrate the parameter estimation process, using Python tools such as SciPy and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
